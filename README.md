# Project Overview

The aim is to use React to develop a single page application featuring a map of with added functionality, including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

- The application shows you the locations of my neighborhood restaurants in my ZIP Code 40511 , Lexington Kentucky
- You can **filter** this list by typing the name of your chosen restaurant in the input bar. The list will adjust accordingly
- When clicking on a name in the list, the **marker will animate** by bouncing on the map to show you the exact location of that the list
- By clicking in the **restaurant on the list** or on the **marker**, an **info window** will be displayed in the bottom left-hand corner of the map
- The content of the info window is provided by the Wikipedia API and is sourced from a  **Wikipedia article** corresponding to the restaurant you have clicked on
